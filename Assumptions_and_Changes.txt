Assumptions:
We are using min-max notation for cardinalities.

A treatment can be a test/procedure at New Haven Urgent Care.  
A follow up is an order to receive a treatment elsewhere.
Cost is only tabulated for procedures performed at New Haven.
A new treatment entity is created for each treatment assigned to a patient to allow for more information to be tracked.
This is also true for diagnosis.
Service providers, clerks, and nurses are all employees.  Other types of employees are not relevant to this diagram.
A provider ID is the employee ID of a service provider.  The same is true for nurses and clerks.
A patient may only visit one time per day.

Binary Relationships: (1,1)

Changes from previous diagram:
Several relations in our original diagram are more aptly described by a ternary relationship:

Visit,supply,nurse form a ternary relationship.  
For each visit, one and only one nurse tracks any number of supplies.
A nurse may track many supplies for a single visit.
A nurse may track many different visits.
A type of supply may be used in many different visits.
A type of supply is tracked by many different nurses.

Visit, diagnosis, and service provider (SP) form a ternary relationship.
For each visit, there is a primary service provider and a diagnosis.
An SP may oversee many different visits.
An SP may provide many diagnoses to a single patient in a single visit.
An SP may provide a similar diagnosis to multiple patients.

Patient, Insurance, and Clerk also form a ternary relationship.
For each patient they have a history of insurance information.
There can be 0 to many entries for their information.
The patient is assigned 1 and only one clerk to intake their information.
The clerk can intake 0 to many insurance information entities from 1 to many patients.
Insurance information can have 1 and only 1 patient that possesses it, and
it can only be intaked by 1 and only 1 clerk.

Treatment, Followup, and Test/Procedure consist of a class hierarchy.
For each visit there is a Test/Procedure which may lead to a Treatment.
After the Treatment there will be a Followup and may lead to another Test/Procedure.
A TreatmentName could determine the cost of the Procedure.


Added several missing attributes/entities:
Patient insurance information and the coresponding attributes
Patient date of birth
Initial assessment attributes
Changed cardinality of Nurse:Inital assessment from 1:1 to 0:M.  A nurse may perform 0 to many initial assessments.
