Assumptions:

A treatment can be a test/procedure at New Haven Urgent Care.  
A follow up is an order to receive a treatment elsewhere.
Cost is only tabulated for procedures performed at New Haven.
Patient insurance data (old and current) are stored as an attribute of the patient.
A new treatment entity is created for each treatment assigned to a patient to allow for more information to be tracked.
This is also true for diagnosis.
Service providers, clerks, and nurses are all employees.  Other types of employees are not relevant to this diagram.
Departments outside of Billing are not relevant to the diagram.
Service providers get a separate "Service Provider" ID, which is different from their employee ID.
